To compute it for the currently-collected profiling information, omit both data and lidict; if you are computing it for saved profiling data, supply both. (data and lidict must be a matched pair from Profile.retrieve().)\n\nYou can control the strategy with the following keywords:\n\nC: if true, include stackframes collected from ccalled code.\ncombine: if true, instruction pointers that correspond to the same line of code are combined into a single stackframe\npruned: a list of (funcname, filename) pairs that trigger the termination of this branch of the flame graph. You can use this to prevent very \"tall\" graphs from deeply-recursive calls, e.g., pruned = [(\"sort!\", \"sort.jl\")] would omit nodes corresponding to Julia's sort! function and anything called by it.

The starting index begins with the caller's starting span but increments to ensure each child's span occupies a distinct subset of the caller's span.

See FlameColors for the default implementation of fcolor.\n\nIf you provide a custom fcolor, it must support the following API:\n\ncolorbg = fcolor(:bg)\ncolorfont = fcolor(:font)\n\nmust return the background and font colors.\n\ncolornode = fcolor(nextidx::Vector{Int}, j, data::NodeData)\n\nchooses the color for the node represented by data (see NodeData). j corresponds to depth in the call stack and nextidx[j] holds the state for the next color choice. In general, if you have a list of colors, fcolor should cycle nextidx[j] to ensure that the next call to fcolor with this j moves on to the next color. (However, you may not want to increment nextidx[j] if you are choosing the color by some means other than cycling through a list.)\n\nBy accessing data.sf, you can choose to color individual nodes based on the identity of the stackframe.\n\ncostscale\n\ncostscale can be used to limit the size of img when profiling collected a large number of stacktraces. The size of the first dimension of img is proportional to the total number of stacktraces collected during profiling. costscale is the constant of proportionality; for example, setting costscale=0.2 would mean that size(img, 1) would be approximately 1/5 the number of stacktraces collected by the profiler. The default value of nothing imposes an upper bound of approximately 1000 pixels along the first dimension, with costscale=1 chosen if the number of samples is less than 1000.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/#FlameGraphs.flametags","page":"Reference","title":"FlameGraphs.flametags","text":"tagimg = flametags(g, img)\n\nFrom a flame graph g, generate an array tagimg with the same axes as img, encoding the stackframe represented by each pixel of img.\n\nSee flamepixels to generate img.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"reference/#FlameGraphs.FlameColors","page":"Reference","title":"FlameGraphs.FlameColors","text":"fcolor = FlameColors(n::Integer; colorbg=colorant\"white\", colorfont=colorant\"black\", colorrt=colorant\"red\", colorgc=colorant\"orange\")\n\nChoose a set of colors for rendering a flame graph.

FlameColors chooses two lists of length n, one for even depths in the stacktrace and the other for odd depths in the stacktrace.
